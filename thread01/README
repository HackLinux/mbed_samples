This is taken directly from the stm32f4d examples and adapted for
the mbed.

This is a very simple threaded application.  Cooperative multithreading
is perhaps the correct term.  The scheduler is more than that it is
the operating system, if you will, it initalizes the hardware and has
api calls for the threads to use.  Then it goes into its loop that
round robin calls the thread handlers.  Each thread handler needs to
get in and get out fast.  No stopping to poll or anything like that.
You can poll in the sense that you try once per heartbeat for example
and that is how these happen to work, no interrupts are needed to
demonstrate threading.

Future examples can/will do things like have the scheduler use different
messages, perhaps watch the timer for you and send you a specific message
on a particular time interval so you dont have to.  Later make that
interrupt driven.
