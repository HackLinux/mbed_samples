This is a collection of sample programs, in some respects building
on each other for the mbed (http://mbed.org) platform.  This subdirectory
the mzero subdirectory, specifically is for the lpc11u24 based mbed.
The main directory is for the original lpc17xx based mbed.  The lpc11u24
uses a cortex-m0 ARM core.

These samples are intended to demonstrate how to use the platform
without using the web compiler or mbed api.  This will hopefully
get you kick started into learning to program the hardware directly
using the reference material provided by the vendor(s).

At a minimum you will need some documents, starting at

http://mbed.org

go to the handbook page (Handbook link top right of page)

http://mbed.org/handbook

This web page appears to keep changing, at the moment near the top
of the page under About mbed find the link for the LPC11U24 based
mbed:

http://mbed.org/handbook/mbed-NXP-LPC11U24

You are going to need the schematic

http://mbed.org/media/uploads/chris/mbed-010.2-schematic.pdf

Then follow the link to the LPC11U24 homepage at nxp.

There is a link to a zip file called all documentation, you may find some
interesting information there but it does not have the users manual
which is the most important of the programming manuals as it has all
the register/memory addresses and descriptions.  I struggled to find
this manual for this processor then eventually did, the problem is it
is listed as the LPC11Uxx manual and when you look inside you see it
is the LPC11Uxx manual.

user manuals for the nxp cortex-m0 processors

And specifically what is at the moment shown on the nxp website as
the LPC11U1x user manual:

For now start with the blinker02 example and go from there.
