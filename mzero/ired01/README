This sample program demonstrates using an ir (infra red) receiver module
in particular the one from sparkfun

The way these work is that you supply power and ground, 3.3 or whatever
you are using on your microcontroller, and there is an output pin this
output is the demodulated IR signal.  You ultimately want to decode
this signal by measuring the pulses, each IR command has a different
sequence/encoding.

This example simply demonstrates that it works.  When the receiver
output changes the microcontroller changes its led, so normally the led
is off when the output of the ir module is high, when the ir module
pulses low, the led pulses high and comes on.

Note that not all ir modules use the same pinout and the dont always
use high for off and low for on.

Decoding will be a future example
