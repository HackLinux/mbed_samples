This example is using the cortex-m0 based mbed as an AVR ISP.

The AVR board used initially is the Sparkfun pro micro 8Mhz/3.3v

http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10999

From an AVR document the chips with this serial isp are either byte
mode or page mode.  This chip atmega32u4 is page mode so you load a
temporary buffer with 64 instructions, then send one command to program
that buffer into a page of flash.

The serial protocol is quite trivial so writing code to use it or modify
this program is simple.

At this time the code only supports one page/buffer, 64 instructions.

At this time not worrying about exact timing, it is fast enough using
count to N loops.
