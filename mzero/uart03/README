derived from uart02. and blinker05 (see blinker05 and blinker04 about
using something other than the internal clock).

PCLK set to 48MHz.  Two uart init methods shown, the simplest is to
divide the UART_PCLK by four, resulting in a 12Mhz clock which is what
uart02 used.  No need to change the fractional divisors, etc.  The other
method is to follow the flowchart in the users manual to come up with
a fractional divisor, in this case 1.533333.... 1 + 8/15.  With a DLL
of 17.

The microcontroller uses the USART to communicate here, it is in this
example configured to connec to the mbed interface which acts as a
usb to serial adapter so you dont need a separate serial interface.
Find the /dev/ttyACM# associated with the mbed.
